# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing for Ames Housing Dataset üßπ

This project focuses on the essential data cleaning and preprocessing steps required to prepare the Ames Housing dataset for a machine learning model. The primary goal is to handle missing values, correct data types, engineer new features, and encode categorical data using Python and the Pandas library.

## Dataset üìä

The dataset used is the "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques" from Kaggle. It contains 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, with the goal of predicting the final sale price.

**Note:** The `train.csv` file is not included in this repository due to its size and to follow best practices. Please download it from the link above and place it in the project's root directory.

## Project Objectives üéØ

The main objectives of this data preparation project are:

-   Load the raw data and perform an initial exploratory data analysis (EDA).
-   Identify and handle missing values (`NaN`) using appropriate imputation strategies (median, mode, or constant values).
-   Correct data types for columns that are read incorrectly (e.g., numerical codes representing categories).
-   Perform feature engineering to create more meaningful variables (e.g., `TotalSF`).
-   Encode categorical features into a numerical format using one-hot encoding.
-   Produce a clean, analysis-ready DataFrame to be used for model training.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

-   Python 3.x
-   Pandas
-   NumPy
-   Matplotlib & Seaborn (for analysis and visualization)
